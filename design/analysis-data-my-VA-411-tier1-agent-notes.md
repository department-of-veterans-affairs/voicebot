Word clouds visualize textual data by displaying the most frequently used words and are useful for providing a quick snapshot of a document’s contents. It is important to eliminate frequently used words with little semantic value, collectively referred to as stop words, such as “was”, “because”, and “is,” for the visuals to be effective. This analysis uses the standard stop words from the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) library, in addition to a custom list of words adapted for the domain.
