## FOIA

Freedom of Information Act	

At times the Freedom of Information Act requires that government agencies provide documentation to those requesting it. However, not all information in every document is applicable to each FOIA request. When a FOIA request requires a document to be edited before being released to the FOIA requester, the version of the document produced as part of that FOIA request must be maintained as a separate document.	

- Any document cleaned up for FOIA
