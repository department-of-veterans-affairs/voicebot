## Moderator Logistics
### Day of the Session
1.	Use #feedback-backchannel in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.
2.	Mute your Slack notifications.
3.	Send out the observer instructions to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into #feedback-backchannel).

### Starting the Session
1.	In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.
2.	In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked
3.	Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.
4.	When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*
 <P> <BR>
   
## Observer Instructions
### Before the session starts, here are some guidelines:
1.	You may change your video conference display name to be just your first or preferred name. We encourage you not to change your name to “observer.”
2.	Sign into the session with your microphone muted.
3.	If you aren’t admitted directly: Wait in the MS Teams waiting room while the moderator begins the session - If the participant approves your presence, as in the majority of cases, the moderator will soon admit observers into the session - If there are issues, the moderator should be in contact via Slack.
4.	At the moderator’s prompt, unmute your camera and microphone and briefly introduce yourself with: Your first or preferred name - Your role with VA.gov.
5.	When that’s done: - Mute your microphone - Turn off your camera.
6.	Confine all messaging to the Slack Voicebot_test1_feedbackchannel thread for the session: - Don’t message within the video conference app - Don’t expect the moderator to interact with you.
7. **Notetaker:** Friendly reminder to take notes that are as close to verbatim as possible.
   
## OCTO Introduction
   
### Introduction - 5 minutes

**TECH REP: Shares MS PowerPoint visual in Presentation Mode – Welcome Slide.** 

**Moderator:** Thanks for joining us today! My name is **[moderator]** and I have two other colleagues on the call, **(Tech Support)** will be our tech support today and **(Notetaker)** is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the MS Teams waiting room who would like to observe and take notes.

- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure that this is alright before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?<br>
- If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the MS Teams call.
  
- If yes: Admit observers.
  
- Thank you for that. I’m now going to ask each person on the line to introduce themselves and their position on the VA Voicebot project.
  
**Facilitator asks each observer/notetaker to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with the VA Voicebot project. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)**

Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth.
   
**TECH REP: Change to slide Voicebot simple description.**

**Moderator:** Our goal for today is to gather feedback on a prototype Voicebot for telephone interaction with the VA.
- This Voicebot uses natural language understanding & voice interaction technology. 
- This is similar to what you might find from smart speakers - like Amazon Alexa, Apple’s Siri and Google’s Hey Google – which analyze someone’s speech and what they are asking when it interacts with them. We are working on this technology to improve the experience of contacting the VA about topics related to veteran disability, compensation claim status, and understanding the PACT Act.

**Moderator:** Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
- This entire session should take about 1 hour. 
- I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic. 
- The agenda begins with some warm-up questions. 
- Next, we will engage with the Voicebot during three different tasks. 
- And finally, I will close with a few follow up questions, and allow some additional time for you to ask us any questions that you may have.
**(IF APPROPRIATE:)** You'll be interacting with a prototype. 
- This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect.
- Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. 
- We just want to improve this prototype to better meet Veteran's needs. 
- I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. It is important to remember that there are no right or wrong answers. We are here to learn from you and really try to understand your experience and what you would like from a Voicebot in the future. So please do not feel that you need to hold anything back. We want to hear everything!
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly they will be kept anonymous.
- If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
   
**TECH REP: Start Recording.**

**Moderator:** I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Your heading.
   
**TECH REP: Start the Transcript Under Closed Captioning.** 
   
- Do you have any questions at this point?

 <P> <BR>
   
### Warm-Up Questions - 5 minutes
   
**Moderator:** "Let’s start with a few warm-up questions."

1.	So we have an understanding that you have filed a disability compensation claim with the VA previously.  Could you tell us a bit about what you recall about the experience of that process?

**Possible follow up:**
- How did you feel the VA communicated to you during the claim process as to the progress of your claim being processed?

2.	Can you tell us about a time you have called the VA?

4.	At what point do you call the VA for something and why?

6.	On a scale (add satisfaction scale) and how satisfied were you?

**Possible Follow ups:**
- What was the most helpful or satisfying aspect of calling?
- If you had a magic wand, What would it take for an automated phone assistant- to be able to offer you to keep you from needing/wanting to talk to an agent?
 <P> <BR>

### First Task: Open Discussion About Persona - 15 minutes

 **Moderator:** Thank you for answering those questions.
- What we would like you do consider another Veterans story.

**TECH REP: Slide with Storyboard.** 

**Moderator:** What we would like you to do now is look at the screen and discuss another notional Veteran’s experience with filing a disability compensation claim.  
- Let’s get familiar with Tati and their basic story.

 **Review basic story board to introduce where the persona is at in the process and prompt participant to ideate questions.**

**Frame 1:** Tati going through the mail and sees her intent to file letter that she got in the mail from the VA in January. Tati wonders what is going on with her claim at this point.

**Frame 2:** Tati has a few minutes and decides to try and log in to her VA.gov account to see if there any updates on her claim.

**Frame 3:** Tati has a few minutes and decides to try and log in to her VA.gov account to see if there any updates on her claim.

**Frame 4:** Tati feels that she needs further support with this process. After gathering data Tati finds the VA number and contacts them for more information.

**[Participant Name]**, Looking at this information, what might Tati be feeling or thinking about?

**TECH REP: Slide with person bio information**

- Here are some more details about Tati.

**time to review-Veteran reviews silently**
- Now that we are familiar with Tati we would like you to think about what questions you have would have about the status of their claims filing.

- Could you look over and tell us what questions you would have if you were them about their claim?

**[Participant Name]**, Looking at this information, what might Tati be feeling or thinking about?
- As you have looked this over and tell us what questions you would have if you were them about their claim?

- What questions or issues seem obvious to you from this information that [NAME] would want to find out more about?

**discuss Veteran’s considerations and thoughts**
- Now that we are familiar with [NAME] and what areas of their claim status would.
- We would like you to take two minutes and jot notes down on what you would want to know as **[NAME]**
- Lets take a brief moment to have you write down any questions that you may want to ask the Voicebot about your current claims status.
- Second Task: Veteran call the Voicebot - 25 minutes.
   
**Tech Rep: change slide to phone number to call Voicebot.**

**Moderator:** In this Session, we provided you with a "character" to portray and interact with the Voicebot. 
- Now that you have some notes about what to ask the Voicebot about your/Tati's claim we will have you dial (203)- 680-8708 and try to get answers to questions about here claim with the VB.

**Tech Rep: change slide to bio while call is in progress**

**Veteran interacts with VoiceboT**

- Thanks for calling the Voicebot. We would like to ask you questions about the experience.

- How did you think the Voicebot responded to your questions?

- Did it prompt any extra questions?

- Did you feel like you could ask the Voicebot more details about your questions? Why/Why Not?

- How satisfied were you with the information the VB provided?

### Third Task: A/B Audio Content – 5 minutes
**Tech Rep: Change Slide to Version 1 Slide**

**Moderator:** So now, we are going to shift tasks. We are done being Tati but, we want to get your opinions on the way the Voicebot would respond to Veterans about claims timeline information. We are going to have you listen to two different audio recordings to get your preferences between them.
- Please tell us what is more satisfactory? 1st or 2nd?
- In the each recording the Voicebot gave estimates of time about claim status. What do you remember being different between the two recordings?
- Which was more satisfying and why?
- What other type of information would / could have made the Voicebot’s response more helpful?
- Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes
- Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make - sure it really works for Veterans.
- Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.
- Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

### Emergency Exit
**In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an emergency exit strategy. Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.**
