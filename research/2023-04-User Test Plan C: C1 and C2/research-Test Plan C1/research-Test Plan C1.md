# Research Plan for Voicebot User Test C1: Dialogflow Prototype, April 2023


### Background
The VBA Voicebot team seeks to use human-centered design (HCD) research methods to evaluate Veteran expectations and desired experiences for a VBA Voicebot for telephony, specifically its disability compensation claims status related content and information, as well as PACT Act claim general information.

This project will focus on the desired experience for Veterans calling the VA National Call Center and selecting to use the Voicebot telephony option. User research will focus on the desirability and perceived usefulness of claims status and PACT Act related content and information via a notional Voicebot which will inform future product roadmaps and content. The Dialogflow Virtual Agent IVR prototype will be used during usability test with Veterans.  

[NCC's Voicebot Proof of Concept](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/voicebot/blob/master/research/2023-03-User%20Test%20Plan%20B/NCC%20Voicebot%20Proof%20Of%20Concept.md)

### OCTO Objectives
This research supports the following OCTO objectives:

1.	Increase the usage of VA’s self-service products,
2.	Decrease the time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome.
3.	Increase the quality and reliability of VA services.

### Veteran Journey
This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:
- Starting Up
- Taking Care of Myself
- Putting Down Roots
- Retiring
- Aging
- Dyeing

## Research Goals
 - Learn about Veterans’ experiences when they filed VA disability claim(s).
 - Understand Veteran claim status questions based on detailed persona information.
 - Explore general topics about VA disability claim status.  
 - Gather feedback on the Veteran's experience with Voicebot.  
 - Gather feedback on two different versions, A/B testing, of the Voicebot explaining a timeline regarding information on a disability claim status.
 - The insights gained from this research will be used to deliver a Voicebot that Veterans will find useful in answering their questions and easy to interact with.


### Outcome
This research will provide insights into Veterans' pain points and the limitations that they may encounter by interacting with a telephony based virtual agent. This project will also uncover training data, such as words and phrases, that Veterans may use to inquire about their disability claim status and PACT Act related information. The training data will be used to program the Voicebot and ensure that it can provide answers to Veterans' frequently asked questions.  

### Research questions

1.	What are the terminology and phrases that Veterans use to ask questions about their disability claims status?
2.	What were some of Veteran’s pain points when filing a VA disability claim.
3.	What were the positive aspects of filing a VA disability claim?
4.	What version of the Voicebot’s claim status timeline will the A Veteran feel most satisfied with?



### Hypothesis
*H<sub>1</sub>: If the Voicebot provides a Veteran with a reasonable claim status timeline, then a Veteran will be satisfied with the information, and will have no need to further escalate the call to a NCC agent.*


## Methodology
### Moderated Usability Test
The research will consist of 7 moderated remote usability test sessions using the Zoom platform. The test will include a moderator, a notetaker, a visual technician, and observers. The visual technician will display information that the Veterans will need to perform each task; this technician will also dial a telephone number to the Dialogflow’s Voicebot prototype via the Zoom platform so that the Veteran can interact with the Voicebot.

### Location
The user research sessions will be will be held remotely via the Zoom platform.

A diverse sample of participants will be recruited across all of the following criteria:
-	Various mix of ages
-	Various mix of sexes
-	Various mix of races
-	Various mix of education levels
-	Various mix of branches of service

- 	Yes (Recruit)
- 	No (Disqualify)

### Timeline
Perigean will begin Veteran recruitment on April 24, 2023
Actual user test sessions are projected to commence on May 1, 2023 and end on May 5, 2023.
