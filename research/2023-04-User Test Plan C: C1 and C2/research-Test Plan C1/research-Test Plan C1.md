# Research Plan for Voicebot User Test Plan C1: Dialogflow Prototype, April 2023

# TBD

### Background
The VBA Voicebot team seeks to use human-centered design (HCD) research methods to evaluate Veteran expectations and desired experiences for a VBA Voicebot for telephony, specifically its disability compensation claims status related content and information, as well as PACT Act claim general information.

This project will focus on the desired experience for Veterans calling the VA National Call Center and selecting to use the Voicebot telephony option. User research will focus on the desirability and perceived usefulness of claims status and PACT Act related content and information via a notional Voicebot which will inform future product roadmaps and content. The Dialogflow Virtual Agent IVR prototype will be used during usability test with Veterans.  

[NCC's Voicebot Proof of Concept](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/voicebot/blob/master/research/2023-03-User%20Test%20Plan%20B/NCC%20Voicebot%20Proof%20Of%20Concept.md)

### OCTO Objectives
This research supports the following OCTO objectives:

1.	Increase the usage of VA’s self-service products,
2.	Decrease the time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome.
3.	Increase the quality and reliability of VA services.

### Veteran Journey
This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:
- Starting Up
- Taking Care of Myself
- Putting Down Roots
- Retiring
- Aging
- Dyeing

## Research Goals
The purpose of this research is to understand Veteran's expectations and desires when interacting with a telephony Voicebot virtual assistant. The insights gained from this research will be used to deliver a Voicebot that Veterans will find useful in answering their questions and easy to interact with.

### Outcome
This research will provide insights into Veterans' pain points and the limitations that they may encounter by interacting with a telephony based virtual agent. This project will also uncover training data, such as words and phrases, that Veterans may use to inquire about their disability claim status and PACT Act related information. The training data will be used to program the Voicebot and ensure that it can provide answers to Veterans' frequently asked questions.
