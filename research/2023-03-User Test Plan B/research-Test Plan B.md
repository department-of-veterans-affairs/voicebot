# Research Plan for Voicebot User Test Plan B: Dialogflow Prototype, March/April 2023

## Background
The VBA Voicebot team seeks to use human-centered design (HCD) research methods to evaluate Veteran expectations and desired experiences for a VBA Voicebot for telephony, specifically its disability compensation claims status related content and information, as well as PACT Act claim general information.

This project will focus on the desired experience for Veterans calling the VA National Call Center and selecting to use the Voicebot telephony option. User research will focus on the desirability and perceived usefulness of claims status and PACT Act related content and information via a notional Voicebot which will inform future product roadmaps and content. The Dialogflow Virtual Agent IVR prototype will be used during usability test with Veterans.

### OCTO Objectives
This research supports the following OCTO objectives:

1.	Increase the usage of VA’s self-service products,
2.	Decrease the time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome.
3.	Increase the quality and reliability of VA services.

### Veteran Journey
This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:
- Starting Up
- Taking Care of Myself
- Putting Down Roots
- Retiring
- Aging
- Dyeing

## Research Goals
The purpose of this research is to understand Veteran's expectations and desires when interacting with a telephony Voicebot virtual assistant. The insights gained from this research will be used to deliver a Voicebot that Veterans will find useful and easy to interact with.

### Outcome
This research will provide insight into Veterans' pain points and the limitations that they may encounter by interacting with a telephony based virtual agent. This project will also uncover training data, such as words and phrases, that Veterans may use to inquire about their disability claim status and PACT Act related information. The training data will be used to program the Voicebot and ensure that it can provide answers to some of Veterans most asked questions.  

### Research questions

1.	What are the words and phrases that Veterans use to ask questions about their disability claims status, or when they inquire about the PACT Act information?
2.	Will the Voicebot provide a pleasant user experience, or will Veterans find it frustrating to use?
3.	Will the Voicebot be able to understand different accents, rates of speech, regional dialects, or speech impediments?
4.	Will the Voicebot provide a consistent and smooth interaction throughout the call?
5.	Will the Voicebot be able to hand-off the call to a NCC Agent when it encounters an error without causing too must frustration for the Veteran?



### Hypothesis
*Hypothesis 1:  If Veterans choose the Voicebot option in the initial phone tree, and provide their PII credentials, then Veterans will be able to get authenticated by the Voicebot and receive personalized information about their disability claims.*

*Hypothesis 2: If Veterans choose the Voicebot option in the initial phone tree, then Veterans will be able to get basic information about the PACT Act and be directed to where they can apply for PACT Act benefits.*


## Methodology
### Moderated Usability Test
The research will consist of seven moderated remote usability testing sessions using the Zoom platform. The test will include a moderator, a notetaker, a visual/dial-out technician, and observers. The call technician will dial a telephone number to the Dialoflow Voicebot protoype via the Zoom platform so that the Vetaran can interact with the Voicebot.

## Location
The user research sessions will be moderated and will be held remotely via the Zoom platform.

## Recruitment
### Recruitment criteria
This research will be using OCTO's Perigean recruiting contractor to recruit seven Veterans using a maximum variation strategy. A diverse sample of participants will be recruited across all of the following criteria:
-	Various mix of ages
-	Various mix of sexes
-	Various mix of races
-	Various mix of education levels
-	Various mix of branches of service
-	Various mix of residence areas
We request a Perigean recruitment Kick-off meeting on the following day:
-  Friday, March 17: Anytime between 1:30 pm and 3:00 pm eastern standard time.
### Primary Criteria 
At least one of the following recruitment criteria must be met in order for a Veteran to be considered for this study:
- Veterans who have prior experience with filing a VA disability compensation claim.
- Veterans who are currently in the process of filing a VA disability compensation claim.
- Veterans who have submitted a PACT Act disability compensation claim.
- Veterans who are preparing to submit a PACT Act disability compensation claim. 
#### Screener Questions
In order for a Veteran to be recruited for this study, they must answer “Yes” **to at least one**, of the two questions:
1.	Have you ever filed, or are currently in the process of filing, a disability compensation claim with the VA?
o	Yes (Recruit)
o	No (Disqualify)

2.	Have you ever submitted, are in the process of submitting, or are preparing to submit a PACT Act disability compensation claim?
o	Yes (Recruit)
o	No (Disqualify)



## Timeline
Participant recruitment by Perigean will begin on March 20, 2023
Actual user test sessions are projected to commence on March 27, 2023 and end on March 30, 2023.

## Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a Midpoint review.

A pilot session was conducted on March 9, 2023 at 12:00-1:30 p.m. eastern standard time. The mock participant was a Booz Allen Hamilton employee XXXXX.

## Research Sessions
Planned dates of research:
March 27, 2023-March 30, 2023

### Length of sessions
Session length: 
The length of user sessions will be 1 hour in length. 

Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time)
Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)

Please request enough dates and at least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; 12 time slots for 6 participants). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
