# Research Plan for Voicebot VBA IVR 03-2023

## Background

The VBA Voicebot team seeks to use human-centered design (HCD) research methods to evaluate Veteran expectations and desired experiences for a VBA voicebot for telephony, specifically its disability compensation claims status related content and information, as well as PACT Act claim general information.

This project will focus on the desired experience for Veterans calling the VA National Call Center and selecting to use the Voicebot telephony option. User research will focus on the desirability and perceived usefulness of claims status and PACT Act related content and information via a notional Voicebot which will inform future product roadmaps and content.

Briefly summarize the high level questions your research was trying to answer.

This study will seek to find insight into how best to provide veterans' answers to general claims status and previously filled compensation claims.
How best to provide personalized claim status and answer questions that veteran may have.
How best to provide information and answer Veterans’ question regarding the PACT Act.

What problem is your product trying to solve?
Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)
What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?

## OCTO Objectives
Omnichannel Initiative
1.	Increase the usage and throughput of VA services.
2.	Decrease the time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome.
3.	Increase the quality and reliability of VA services.

## Veteran Journey
- Starting Up
- Taking Care of Myself
- Putting Down Roots
- Retiring
- Aging
- Dyeing

## Research Goals

This user research is seeking to understand Veteran's expectations and desires around the information and interactions a telephony Voicebot assistant can provide about Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) claims status and PACT Act related topics.

## Outcome
How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?

## Research questions
Consider bucketing research questions under research goals. For each question, think about:

What will I do with what I learn from this question?
Does this question serve the goals of my study?
Do not write out all questions you plan to ask participants -- that should go in the conversation guide.
Hypothesis
What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.

What do you already know about this problem space?
What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)
Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study.
Remember to constrain the hypothesis to the goals of your study!

## Methodology
Describe the method you’re planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and maturity of the design.

Examples of common research methods include:

Semi-structured interviews - appropriate for generative research
Contextual inquiry - appropriate for generative research
Card sorts - appropriate for generative and evaluative research; depending on the study design
Tree tests - appropriate for evaluative research
Usability testing - appropriate for evaluative research
User acceptance testing (UAT) - required before product release
Additional resources:

Please review the PRA primer to educate yourself on how PRA impacts the research we do as a government project.
Review the Perigean recruitment guidance to understand how Perigean recruits, and what types of research they can support.
If conducting testing on mobile, refer to the mobile research guidelines.
If conducting unmoderated usability research, refer to the guidance here.
If conducting research with disabled Veterans, refer to this checklist and follow disability etiquette guidelines.
In the rare event of an emergency during research, be prepared by reviewing guidelines for research safety and emergency exit strategies.

## Location
The user research sessions will be moderated and will be held remotely via the Zoom platform.

## Recruitment
This study requires will recruit seven Vetarans using OCTO's Perigean recruiting contracter. 

## Recruitment criteria
- maximum variation strategy 

### Primary criteria (must-haves) What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study?
The following recruitment criteria must be met in order for a Veteran to participate in this study:
- Veterans who had prior experience with filing a VA disability compensation claim.
- Veterans who are currently in the process of filing a VA disability compensation claim.
- Veterans who have submitted a PACT Act disability compensation claim.
- Veterans who are preparing to submit a PACT Act disability compensation claim. 

#### Screener Questions
1. See Recruitment Intake form submitted on March 12, 2023.

## Timeline
Participant recruitment by Perigean will begin on March 20, 2023
Actual user test sessions are projected to commence on March 27, 2023 and end on March 30, 2023.

## Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a Midpoint review.

A pilot session was conducted on March 9, 2023  at 12:00-1:30 p.m. eastern standard time. The mock participant was a Booz Allen Hamilton employee XXXXX.


## Research Sessions
Planned dates of research:
March 27, 2023-March 30, 2023

### Length of sessions
Session length: 
The length of user sessions will be 1 hour in length. 

Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time)
Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)
Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time. Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.

Please request enough dates and at least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; 12 time slots for 6 participants). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
