# Research Plan for Voicebot User Test Plan B: Dialogflow Prototype, March/April 2023

## Background
The VBA Voicebot team seeks to use human-centered design (HCD) research methods to evaluate Veteran expectations and desired experiences for a VBA Voicebot for telephony, specifically its disability compensation claims status related content and information, as well as PACT Act claim general information.

This project will focus on the desired experience for Veterans calling the VA National Call Center and selecting to use the Voicebot telephony option. User research will focus on the desirability and perceived usefulness of claims status and PACT Act related content and information via a notional Voicebot which will inform future product roadmaps and content. The Dialogflow Virtual Agent IVR prototype will be used during usability test with Veterans.

### OCTO Objectives
This research supports the following OCTO objectives:

1.	Increase the usage of VA’s self-service products,
2.	Decrease the time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome.
3.	Increase the quality and reliability of VA services.

### Veteran Journey
This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:
- Starting Up
- Taking Care of Myself
- Putting Down Roots
- Retiring
- Aging
- Dyeing

## Research Goals
The purpose of this research is to understand Veteran's expectations and desires when interacting with a telephony Voicebot virtual assistant. The insights gained from this research will be used to deliver a Voicebot that Veterans will find useful in answering their questions and easy to interact with.

### Outcome
This research will provide insights into Veterans' pain points and the limitations that they may encounter by interacting with a telephony based virtual agent. This project will also uncover training data, such as words and phrases, that Veterans may use to inquire about their disability claim status and PACT Act related information. The training data will be used to program the Voicebot and ensure that it can provide answers to Veterans' frequently asked questions.  

### Research questions

1.	What are the words and phrases that Veterans use to ask questions about their disability claims status, or when they inquire about the PACT Act information?
2.	Will the Voicebot provide a pleasant user experience, or will Veterans find it frustrating to use?
3.	Will the Voicebot be able to understand different accents, rates of speech, regional dialects, or speech impediments?
4.	Will the Voicebot provide a consistent and smooth interaction throughout the call?
5.	Will the Voicebot be able to hand-off the call to a NCC Agent when it encounters an error without causing too must frustration for the Veteran?



### Hypothesis
*Hypothesis 1:  If Veterans choose the Voicebot option in the initial phone tree, and provide their PII credentials, then Veterans will be able to get authenticated by the Voicebot and receive personalized information about their disability claims.*

*Hypothesis 2: If Veterans choose the Voicebot option in the initial phone tree, then Veterans will be able to get basic information about the PACT Act and be directed to where they can apply for PACT Act benefits.*


## Methodology
### Moderated Usability Test
The research will consist of seven moderated remote usability test sessions using the Zoom platform. The test will include a moderator, a notetaker, a visual/dial-out technician, and observers. The visual/call technician will display information that the Veterans will need to perform each task; this  technician will also dial a telephone number to the Dialoflow Voicebot protoype via the Zoom platform so that the Vetaran can interact with the Voicebot.

### Location
The user research sessions will be will be held remotely via the Zoom platform.
