# Conversation Guide
This convesation guide is to be used with the Zoom platform with the added Audio Conferencing (telephone call) capability.

- [User Session B Visuals](TBD)
- Voicebot Prototype Phone Number: (203) 680-8708

## Day of the Session
1. Use #feedback-backchannel in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.
2. Mute your Slack notifications.
3. Send out the observer instructions to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into #feedback-backchannel).


## Starting the Session
1. In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.
2. In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked
3. Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.
4. When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

## Observer instructions:
 Before the session starts, here are some guidelines:
1. You may change your video conference display name to be just your first or preferred name. We encourage you **not** to change your name to “observer.”
2. Sign into the session with your microphone muted.
3. If you aren’t admitted directly:  Wait in the MS Teams waiting room while the moderator begins the session - If the participant approves your presence, as in the majority of cases, the moderator will soon admit observers into the session - If there are issues, the moderator should be in contact via Slack.
4. At the moderator’s prompt, unmute your camera and microphone and briefly introduce yourself with:  Your first or preferred name - Your role with VA.gov.
5. When that’s done: - Mute your microphone - Turn off your camera.
6. Confine all messaging to the Slack Voicebot_test1_feedbackchannel thread for the session: - Don’t message within the video conference app - Don’t expect the moderator to interact with you.
7. Notetaker: friendly reminder to take notes that are as close to verbatim as possible. 
Octo Introduction. [TIME]


## Intro - 5 minutes


- **TECH REP: Shares powerpoint visual in presentation mode – Welcome slide.**

**Moderator:** 
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I have two other colleagues on the call, (NAME) will be our tech support today and (NOTETAKER NAME) is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the MS Teams waiting room who would like to observe and take notes.  
-Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure that this is alright before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?                   
- If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the MS Teams call.
- If yes: Admit observers.
- Thank you for that. I’m now going to ask each person on the line to introduce themselves and their position on the VA Voicebot project. 
- Facilitator asks each observer/notetaker to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with the VA Voicebot project. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)]
- Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth

- **TECH REP: Change to slide 3 Voicebot simple description**

**Moderator:** 
Our goal for today is to gather feedback on a prototype Voicebot for telephone interaction with the VA. This Voicebot uses natural language understanding & voice interaction technology. This is similar to what you might find from smart speakers - like Amazon Alexa, Apple’s Siri and Google’s Hey Google – which analyze someone’s speech and what they are asking when it interacts with them. We are working on this technology to improve the experience of contacting the VA about topics related to veteran disability, compensation claim status, and understanding the PACT Act.

**Moderator:** 
Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
- This entire session should take about 1 hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic. The agenda begins with some warm-up questions. Next, we will engage with the Voicebot during three different tasks. And finally, I will close with a few follow up questions, and allow some additional time for you to ask us any questions that you may have.
- (IF APPROPRIATE:) You'll be interacting with a prototype. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. 
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve this prototype to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. It is important to remember that there are no right or wrong answers. We are here to learn from you and really try to understand your experience and what you would like from a Voicebot in the future. So please do not feel that you need to hold anything back. We want to hear everything! 
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly they will be kept anonymous.  

- If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

- **TECH REP: Start recording.** 

**Moderator:** 
I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Your heading...Do you have any questions at this point? 

## Warm-Up Questions [Time]: 

**Moderator:** "Let’s start with a few warm-up questions."

1.	What is your understanding of a Voice assistant?
2.	Do you feel as though voice assistants are effective at helping answer your questions? 
3.	When you were given a choice to interact with a voice assistant during a call, have you accepted or declined the interaction?
4.	How would you rate your feelings of voice assistants? Strongly dislike, dislike, neither dislike or like, like, strongly like voice assistants (1=strongly dislike, 5= strongly like)
5.	Have you ever encountered issues with a voice assistant misunderstanding you? Have your ever encountered issues with a voice assistant on the phone?
6.	if you were initially calling to speak to a live agent, what if anything, would prompt you to choose to talk to a Voicebot?


## First Task: [TASK 1A] - X minutes

**Moderator:** 
Thank you for answering those questions. We are now going to start interacting with the prototype Voicebot. 
Let me explain how that will work:
Our tech rep will dial into the Voicebot from the MS Teams software we are using, and you will speak to Voicebot just like you are talking to us now. This simulates a real phone call. 
All the information you need to complete the call will be on the screen for you to look at. 
Now, I’m going to explain a scenario for you to discuss with the bot, and go over the information you will use. When I’m done explaining – I’ll ask you to repeat it to me to make sure we are on the same page: 

**Scenario: It's been 10 weeks since you have submitted a disability claim with the VA, and you would like to get more details on what is going on with your claim. You feel like it has been long time so far.**

**Moderator:** 
You decide to call the Voicebot to get some information.

- **TECH REP: change slide to call 1**
 
**Moderator:** 
When the Voicebot answers your call, please ask the Voicebot about your claim in your own words. If no information is provided, you can ask the Voicebot "why". You want to understand why it is taking such a long time. Use the provided information on the screen during the call.

- On a scale from very easy (1), to neutral (3), to very difficult (5), how hard was it to understand the information the bot provided?
- Did any of the terminology seem unfamiliar or confusing?
- What other questions would you have liked ask the voicebot that it could not answer? 
- What other topics would you like to know about that Voicebot did not provide? 
- Did receiving information from the Voicebot make you think of additional questions?
- Is it useful for you to hear this information or would you prefer to get the information in a text, email, or link from the Voicebot?
- Thinking back on your call with the Voicebot, can you think of other ways you may have stated your questions to the Voicebot…. specifically…
- What other words of phrases would you use to ask about the PACT Act?
- What other ways would you ask about your claim status

- How do you think is might compare to other ways of getting that information from the VA? (VA.gov, etc)


**Moderator:** 
“Thank you so much for your help with the PACT Act information.” 
“We can offer a short break and then ask some finishing questions to complete our session.”
**break** 



## Post-Task Interview - X minutes
**Moderator:** 
- What did you think of the Voicebot's personality and tone of voice?
- How do you feel about the Voicebot saying "The VA thanks you for your service" at the end of the call? Would you prefer it said something else such as have a nice day? Both? Neither?  
- Was the rate of speech, ok? 
- Did you feel as though you could have asked about anything or exited the conversation at any time?
- Was this frustrating that in order to use the system you had to be authenticated?
- Do names such as "VA Voice Assistant" or " VA Virtual Assistant" make it clear the service is a bot? 
- Overall, what were your thoughts on the call experience?
- What would you like to see eliminated in the call experience?
- What additional questions (excluding claims and PACT) do you wish it could answer? 

**Moderator:** 
The Voicebot is one way to get information from the VA, we were wondering about other sources of information that you may have used:
- Have you called and spoken with a VA agent before? If yes, how does this experience compare with calling into a NCC call agent? Would you prefer using a VB? If not, what would VB need for you to want to select it over an agent?

## Closeout 

**Moderator:** 
“Great, thank you for your feedback today. **Optional: I’m going to take a moment now to open it up to my teammates on the line to see if they have any questions that they might like to ask.**

**Moderator:**
Any questions for me?

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit
[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an emergency exit strategy. Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
