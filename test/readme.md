The Test discipline acts as a service provider to the other disciplines in many respects. Testing focuses primarily on evaluating or assessing  product quality, which is realized through these core practices: find and document defects in software quality; advise on the perceived software quality; validate and prove the assumptions made in design and requirement specifications through concrete demonstration; validate that the software product works as designed; validate that the requirements are implemented appropriately.
